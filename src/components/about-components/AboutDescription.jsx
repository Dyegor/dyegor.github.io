                I have a passion for coding, solving problems, and working on fun but challenging projects as part of a team or solo.
                I enjoy creating web applications with JavaScript, Typescript, and React.js and do not shy away from new technologies, frameworks, and tools that could enhance or deepen my knowledge and skill set.
